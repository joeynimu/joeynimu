Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Joey!

I am a Javascript Engineer from Nairobi, Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª. I mostly build React apps powered by GraphQL backends.
I learn by sharing my knowledge with the community through [blog posts](https://joeynimu.com), workshops, and Open-source. I also hold [Graphql meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Nairobi-GraphQL-Meetup/).

I take contract/project based jobs from time to time. If you wanna discuss about a project, you can drop me an email at joeynimu@gmail.com

During my spare time, I spend time with my family, watching Liverpool FC play and making road trips to discover new places.
