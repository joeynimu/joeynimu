Hey :wave:, I'm Joey!

I am a Javascript Engineer from Nairobi, Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª. I mostly build React apps powered by GraphQL backends.

I learn by sharing my knowledge to the community be it by blog posts, workshops and or doing OS. I also hold Graphql meetups.

During my spare time, I spend time with my family, watching Liverpool FC play and making road trips to discover new places.
